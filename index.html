            the story follows Izuku Midoriya, a boy who was born without a Quirk but still dreams of becoming a 
            superhero himself. He is scouted by the world's greatest hero, All Might, who bestows his Quirk to 
            Midoriya after recognizing his potential, and helps to enroll him in a prestigious high school for 
            superheroes in training.

            One For All and the world's greatest hero, also known as the Symbol of Peace. 
            All Might's habit of smiling was ingrained by his mentor, Nana Shimura, 
            who believed that the ones who smile are the ones who are the strongest. </p>

            originally established and led by All For One, 
            that intends to destroy hero society and return villains to prominence, 
            as they were before the rise of All Might. 
            After the League wins their war with the Meta Liberation Army, 
            Tomura merges both organizations to form the Paranormal Liberation Front.</p>
